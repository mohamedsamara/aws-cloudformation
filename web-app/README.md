# Cloudformation Web App

CloudFormation infrastructure code to automate the provisioning of resources for a full-stack web application. This template defines various AWS resources required to deploy both backend and frontend components, including services like EC2, RDS, S3, CloudFront, IAM Roles, and CodePipeline.

## 📦&nbsp; CloudFormation Features

- IAM Roles Stack: Defines IAM roles for AWS services, including CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, and EC2.
- S3 Buckets Stack: Contains S3 buckets for CodePipeline (backend and frontend) artifacts and frontend build (dist) artifacts.
- Network Stack: Configures VPC, subnets, security groups, and other networking resources.
- EC2 Instance Stack: Deploys an EC2 instance to run the backend Node.js application with the `codedeploy-agent`.
- RDS Instance Stack: Creates an RDS instance for your database (PostgreSQL).
- SSM Stack: The `ssm.yml` template uses SSM Parameter Store to securely store database connection details, such as DB_HOST, DB_NAME, and DB_PORT.
- CloudFront Stack: Configures CloudFront for frontend distribution.
- CodePipeline Stack: Sets up CodePipeline for continuous deployment.

## How CodePipeline Deploys the App

- Backend Deployment: The backend code is pushed to an S3 bucket as an artifact, which is then deployed to the EC2 instance using CodeDeploy.
- Frontend Deployment: The frontend React app is pushed to S3 and distributed through CloudFront for fast content delivery.

## 🔑&nbsp; Key Pair for EC2 Access

In order to securely access your EC2 instance, you will need to provide your own EC2 Key Pair. You can either create a new key pair or use an existing one from the AWS Console.

- Update the Key Pair Name in CloudFormation

  In the [infrastructure/ec2-instance.yml](infrastructure/ec2-instance.yml) file, replace the KeyPairName parameter with the name of your key pair:

  ```yml
  KeyPairName: <Your-KeyPair-Name>
  ```

## Accessing the EC2 Instance

After the EC2 instance is launched, you can SSH into the instance using the .pem file and the public IP address of the instance.

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/your-key-pair.pem ec2-user@<EC2_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP>
```

## CloudFormation Instructions

1. Upload Infrastructure Code to S3

   Run the following command to upload your infrastructure templates to an S3 bucket:

   ```bash
    aws s3 cp ./infrastructure/ s3://<your-bucket-name> --recursive
   ```

   Make sure that the S3 bucket [your-bucket-name] exists.

2. Deploy the CloudFormation Stack

   To deploy the CloudFormation stack, run the following command, replacing the placeholders with your specific values:

   ```bash
   aws cloudformation create-stack \
   --stack-name MyAppDemo \
   --template-body file://main.yml \
   --parameters \
   ParameterKey=GitHubConnectionArn,ParameterValue=<your-github-connection-arn> \
   ParameterKey=MyIpAddress,ParameterValue=<your-ip-address> \
   --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
   ```

## Example Application
